Welcome to ZendTo (C) Julian Field 2016 Jules@Zend.To

Please start at the web site http://zend.to/ as it contains all the
documentation you need to get started. However, other documentation is
included in the package you downloaded.

There is now an installer available from the zend.to website which
will automate the entire process of installing ZendTo onto an otherwise
basically blank server running any of
        CentOS 5 or 6 or 7
        RedHat Enterprise 5 or 6 or 7
        Ubuntu 14 or 16
It will install and configure everything it needs. I strongly advise
you to use that where possible.
Otherwise there are rpm, deb and tgz packages available too.

The configuration files are in /opt/zendto/config.

If you are upgrading from a previous version, look in sbin for
"upgrade_preferences_php" as that automates the process of upgrading
your configuration. Just run it without any arguments and it will show
you how to use it.

If you need to use MySQL instead of SQLite, then you will need to setup
the database first, so look in the /opt/zendto/sql/ directory for help.

*** NOTE ***
/var/zendto and its subdirectories must be writeable by the user and
group that your web server is running as!
*** NOTE ***

Please see http://zend.to for all the other documentation, as well as
all the documentation you will find in this package.
