<h4>How secure is {#ServiceTitle#}?</h4>

<p>
All files are transferred across the network securely encrypted.
</p>

<p>
All files uploaded and temporarily stored on {#ServiceTitle#} are held
on equipment owned and operated at {#OrganizationType#}'s own
Data Centre.
</p>

<p>
All data is subject to {#OrganizationType#}'s and the country's
Data Protection regulations and laws.
</p>

<p>
{#ServiceTitle#} is in no way a "cloud" service. Everything is stored
(even temporarily) on equipment directly owned by {#OrganizationType#},
and managed by its own IT staff.
</p>

<p>
All access to data is very tightly and strictly controlled by
{#OrganizationType#}. All accesses to data on {#ServiceTitle#} are
logged and can be easily checked if you are ever concerned that a
3rd party might have gained access to your data.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, uploaded data is only held on {#ServiceTitle#} for a maximum
of {$keepForDays} days, after which time it is automatically
deleted. There is no "undelete" facility available at all. No backups are
taken of the uploaded data (it's only a transitory stopping point), so no
uploaded data ever moves off {#ServiceTitle#} itself onto other equipment
or media such as backup tapes. After an uploaded file has been deleted,
there is no way of recovering the file.
